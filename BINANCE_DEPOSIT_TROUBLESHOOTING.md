🚨 **BINANCE DEPOSIT TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE**

Your 500 PHP deposit isn't showing up in your USDC balance. Here's how to fix it:

## 🔍 **Step 1: Check Your Binance Account**
1. **Log into Binance website/app**
2. **Go to Wallet → Spot Wallet**
3. **Look for USDC balance**
4. **Check if deposit is pending/processing**

## 📥 **Step 2: Verify Deposit Method**
**If you deposited PHP:**
- PHP deposits need to be **converted to USDC**
- Go to **Trade → Convert** 
- Convert your PHP to USDC
- Or use **Buy Crypto** to convert PHP to USDC

**If you deposited USDC directly:**
- Check **Wallet → Transaction History**
- Look for pending deposits
- Deposits can take 10-30 minutes to confirm

## 🔄 **Step 3: Check Deposit Network**
- Make sure you used the correct network (BSC, ETH, TRC20)
- Wrong network = funds stuck/lost
- Check deposit address was correct

## 💡 **Step 4: Contact Binance Support**
If deposit is missing after 1 hour:
- Go to **Support → Submit a Request**
- Provide transaction hash and deposit details

## 🚀 **Step 5: Enable Live Trading (Once Balance Shows)**
After your USDC balance appears:
1. **Set LIVE_TRADING=true** in Railway environment
2. **Restart the Discord bot**
3. **Use /balance command** - should show your real $8 USD

**💰 Expected Result:** 500 PHP = ~$8.62 USD = 8.62 USDC balance
