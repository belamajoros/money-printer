## 🎛 **AI Model Configuration & Tuning**

### 📊 **Model Parameter Tuning**

The AI models can be customized by editing parameters in `src/config.py`:

#### **Random Forest Parameters** (Lines 106-118):
```python
RANDOM_FOREST_PARAMS = {
    "n_estimators": 200,        # Number of trees (50-500, more = better but slower)
    "max_depth": 12,            # Tree depth (6-20, deeper = more complex)
    "min_samples_leaf": 4,      # Min samples per leaf (2-10, higher = smoother)
    "min_samples_split": 8,     # Min samples to split (4-20, higher = smoother)
    "max_features": "sqrt",     # Features per split ("sqrt", "log2", 0.1-1.0)
    "class_weight": "balanced", # Handle imbalanced data (None, "balanced")
    "random_state": RANDOM_STATE,
    "n_jobs": -1,              # Use all CPU cores
    "oob_score": True,         # Out-of-bag score validation
    "bootstrap": True,         # Bootstrap sampling
}
```

#### **XGBoost Parameters** (Lines 119-131):
```python
XGBOOST_PARAMS = {
    "n_estimators": 300,        # Number of boosting rounds (100-1000)
    "max_depth": 10,            # Tree depth (3-15, deeper = more complex)
    "learning_rate": 0.05,      # Step size (0.01-0.3, lower = slower but better)
    "subsample": 0.8,           # Row sampling ratio (0.5-1.0)
    "colsample_bytree": 0.8,    # Column sampling ratio (0.5-1.0)
    "objective": "binary:logistic",
    "random_state": RANDOM_STATE,
    "use_label_encoder": False,
    "eval_metric": "logloss"
}
```

### 🎯 **Parameter Tuning Guidelines**

**For Higher Accuracy (but slower training):**
- Increase `n_estimators` (Random Forest: 300-500, XGBoost: 500-1000)
- Increase `max_depth` (Random Forest: 15-20, XGBoost: 12-15)
- Decrease `learning_rate` (XGBoost: 0.01-0.03)

**For Faster Training (but potentially lower accuracy):**
- Decrease `n_estimators` (Random Forest: 100-150, XGBoost: 100-200)
- Decrease `max_depth` (Random Forest: 8-10, XGBoost: 6-8)
- Increase `learning_rate` (XGBoost: 0.1-0.2)

**For Better Generalization (reduce overfitting):**
- Increase `min_samples_leaf` (Random Forest: 6-10)
- Increase `min_samples_split` (Random Forest: 10-20)
- Decrease `subsample` and `colsample_bytree` (XGBoost: 0.6-0.7)
