# 🚀 Live Trading Setup Guide

## Current Issue: Balance Shows "Unable to fetch"

The trading bot is currently in **Paper Trading Mode**, which is why it shows "Unable to fetch" for the balance instead of your real Binance balance.

## ✅ Solution: Enable Live Trading

### Step 1: Set Railway Environment Variable

You need to add the `LIVE_TRADING` environment variable to your Railway deployment:

1. **Go to Railway Dashboard**
   - Visit [railway.app](https://railway.app)
   - Navigate to your Money Printer project
   - Click on your deployed service

2. **Add Environment Variable**
   - Go to "Variables" tab
   - Click "New Variable"
   - Set: `LIVE_TRADING` = `true`
   - Click "Add"

3. **Deploy Changes**
   - Click "Deploy" to apply the changes
   - Wait for deployment to complete

### Step 2: Verify API Keys Are Set

Make sure these environment variables are properly set in Railway:

```
BINANCE_API_KEY=your_real_binance_api_key
BINANCE_SECRET_KEY=your_real_binance_secret_key
LIVE_TRADING=true
```

## ⚠️ Important Warnings

### 🔴 LIVE TRADING RISKS
Once you enable `LIVE_TRADING=true`, the bot will:
- ✅ Display your **real Binance balance**
- ✅ Execute **real trades** with real money
- ✅ Place **actual buy/sell orders** on Binance
- ⚠️ Use your **real USDC** for trading

### 🛡️ Safety Features Active
The bot has comprehensive safety mechanisms:
- Daily trade limits (max 50 trades/day)
- Hourly trade limits (max 10 trades/hour)
- Position sizing based on account balance
- Stop-loss protection
- Volatility filters
- Minimum balance checks

### 💰 Recommended for Live Trading
- **Minimum Balance**: $100+ USDC for meaningful trades
- **Start Small**: Consider starting with $50-200 to test
- **Monitor Closely**: Watch the Discord notifications
- **Have Stop-Loss**: All trades include automatic stop-loss

## 📊 What Changes After Enabling Live Trading

### Before (Paper Trading):
```
💰 Current Balance: $1000 (Paper)
📊 All trades are simulated
🔄 No real money involved
```

### After (Live Trading):
```
💰 Current Balance: $X.XX USDC (Real Binance Balance)
📊 All trades use real money
💸 Real profits and losses
```

## 🔧 Testing the Setup

1. **Set Environment Variable**: `LIVE_TRADING=true`
2. **Wait for Deployment**: ~2-3 minutes
3. **Check Bot Status**: Use `/status` command in Discord
4. **Verify Balance**: Should show your real USDC balance

## 🆘 If Something Goes Wrong

### Balance Still Shows "Unable to fetch"

3. Ensure API keys have trading permissions
4. Check Binance API restrictions

2. **Redeploy** the service
3. **Monitor** any open positions manually in Binance

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. Set `LIVE_TRADING=true` in Railway
2. Verify real balance appears in Discord
