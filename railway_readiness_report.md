## 🎯 Railway Deployment Steps

### 1. Repository Setup
```bash
# Your code is already pushed to GitHub
git remote -v
# origin  https://github.com/vinny-Kev/money-printer.git
```

### 2. Railway Project Creation
1. Go to [Railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Connect your GitHub account
3. Select your `money-printer` repository
4. Railway will auto-detect the Docker configuration

### 3. Environment Variables Setup
In Railway dashboard, add these environment variables:
```bash
BINANCE_API_KEY=your_real_api_key
BINANCE_SECRET_KEY=your_real_secret_key
GOOGLE_DRIVE_FOLDER_ID=1tIujkkmknMOTKprDGhZiab3FYF_Qzpmj
GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON=base64_encoded_service_account_json
ENVIRONMENT=production
TRADING_ENABLED=true  # ENABLED for full trading functionality
LIVE_TRADING=true     # ENABLED for live trading
```

### 4. Service Account Setup
```bash
# Encode your service account JSON for Railway
base64 -i secrets/service_account.json
# Copy the output to GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON variable
```

### 5. Deploy & Monitor
- Railway will automatically build and deploy
- Monitor logs in Railway dashboard
- Check health endpoint: `https://your-app.railway.app/health`

## ✅ Expected Railway Behavior

### On Startup
1. **Container builds** using `Dockerfile.full`
2. **Dependencies install** from `requirements-minimal.txt`
3. **Environment loads** from Railway variables
4. **Google Drive connects** using service account
5. **Binance API connects** for market data
6. **Health check starts** on `/health` endpoint
7. **Data collection begins** automatically

### During Operation
