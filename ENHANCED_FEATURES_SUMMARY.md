# Multi-factor confidence calculation
if rsi < 30:  # Oversold
    confidence = 0.45 + random.uniform(0, 0.25)
elif rsi > 70:  # Overbought  
    confidence = 0.15 + random.uniform(0, 0.15)

# MACD trend analysis
if macd > macd_signal:  # Bullish
    confidence += 0.1
else:  # Bearish
    confidence -= 0.05
