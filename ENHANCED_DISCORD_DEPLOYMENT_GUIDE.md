# 🚀 Enhanced Discord Bot Deployment Guide

## Overview
This guide covers deploying the **enhanced Discord trading bot** to Railway with full scraping, training, and trading capabilities accessible through Discord commands.

## 🎯 What You'll Get

After following this guide, you'll have:
- ✅ **Live Discord Bot** running 24/7 on Railway
- ✅ **Data Scraping** via Discord commands (`/start_scraper`)
- ✅ **Model Training** via Discord commands (`/train_model`)

- ✅ **Real-time Monitoring** via Discord (`/status`, `/trading_stats`)
- ✅ **Automatic Health Checks** for Railway compatibility
- ✅ **Ultra-lightweight** deployment (~170MB container)

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Prepare Environment Variables

Set these in your Railway dashboard:

```env
# Discord Bot Configuration
DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token_here
DISCORD_USER_ID=your_discord_user_id_here

# Binance API (for live trading - optional for paper trading)
BINANCE_API_KEY=your_binance_api_key
BINANCE_SECRET_KEY=your_binance_secret_key

# Optional: Additional Configuration
PORT=8000  # Railway sets this automatically
```

### Step 2: Deploy to Railway

1. **Connect Repository** to Railway
2. **Select Enhanced Bot** deployment
3. **Set Environment Variables** (above)
4. **Deploy** - Railway will automatically build the Docker container

### Step 3: Verify Deployment

Check Railway logs for these success indicators:
```
✅ Enhanced Discord Bot logged in as YourBotName
✅ Trading modules loaded successfully
✅ Scraper modules loaded successfully  
✅ Model training modules loaded successfully
✅ Health check server started on 0.0.0.0:8000
✅ Synced X command(s)
```

### Step 4: Test Discord Commands

In your Discord server, try:
```
/status
```
You should see a comprehensive status showing available systems.

## 🎮 Using the Bot

### Starting Your First Trading Session

1. **Check System Status**
   ```
   /status
   ```

2. **Start Data Collection**
   ```
   /start_scraper
   ```
   *Let this run for 10-15 minutes to collect initial data*

3. **Train Your First Model**
   ```
   /train_model random_forest
   ```
   *This creates the AI model for trading decisions*

4. **Test with Paper Trading**

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Bot Won't Start
**Symptoms:** Railway shows deployment failed
**Solutions:**
1. Check environment variables are set correctly
2. Verify Discord bot token is valid
3. Check Railway build logs for specific errors

### Discord Commands Not Working
**Symptoms:** Bot online but commands fail
**Solutions:**
1. Verify you're the authorized user (DISCORD_USER_ID)
2. Check bot has proper Discord permissions
3. Try `/deploy_test` to check system status

### Limited Features Available
**Symptoms:** `/status` shows systems unavailable
**Solutions:**
1. This is expected in lightweight mode
2. Bot will gracefully handle missing dependencies
3. Health checks will still work for Railway

### Trading Commands Fail
**Symptoms:** Paper trading doesn't work
**Solutions:**
1. Ensure scraper has been running (`/start_scraper`)
2. Train a model first (`/train_model`)
3. Check `/status` for system availability

### Performance Issues
**Symptoms:** Slow responses or timeouts
**Solutions:**
1. Check Railway resource limits
2. Monitor with `/status` command
3. Restart scraper if running too long

## 🎯 Production Best Practices

### Security
- ✅ Keep Discord bot token secure
- ✅ Limit authorized users (DISCORD_USER_ID)
- ✅ Use Railway's secure environment variables
- ✅ Regular token rotation

### Operations
- ✅ Monitor `/status` regularly
